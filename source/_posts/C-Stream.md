# Writing to Files



You can also use **fputc** to write a single character at a time, or **fputs** to write a string without any format conversions. That is, if you do **fputs("%d")** it will just print "%d"to the file directly rather than attempting to convert an integer and print the result.



C library functions may buffer the data, and not immediately request that the OS write it. Even once the application makes the requisite system calls to write the data, the OS may buffer it internally for a while before actually writing it out to the underlying hardware device.

# Closing Files

We will not concern ourselves with complex corrective actions when **fclose** failsâ€”printing an error message suffices. However, you should get in the habit of checking its return value. This way, when you are working on real programs, you will check the return value by habit, and at least think about what you should do if it fails.
